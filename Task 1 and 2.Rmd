# Introduction 

Capture-recapture studies were carried out in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in Alaska to monitor populations of a keystone prey species, the snowshoe hare (*Lepus americanus*)^1^.Studies have taken place in five locations in the Tanana Valley since 1998, however available data only includes information from  1998 - 2012 (Figure 1). Data such as sex, age, and weight were documented. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, please see the [metadata](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-bnz.55.22).
